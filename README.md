# Signal-Slot-Counter

A minimal Qt/QML project demonstrating the signal-slot mechanism with a simple counter interface.  
This project was created as a learning tool to understand how signals and slots work in QML.

## 🚀 Features

- Increment and decrement a counter using buttons.
- Custom `signal` to notify value changes.
- `Connections` element used as a `slot` to update UI reactively.
- Clean and modular QML structure.
